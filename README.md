# SADBM
It's the official implementation for the Structure-Aware Diffusion Bridge Model (SADBM) for SAR-to-Optical image translation. Built on Doob’s h-transform, edge-guided enhancement, and hierarchical structural encoding, SADBM delivers state-of-the-art structural fidelity and visual realism—outperforming GANs and diffusion baselines while enabling stronger downstream scene understanding.
